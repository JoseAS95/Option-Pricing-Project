# Option-Pricing-Project
### Option pricing via Monte Carlo, the analytical Black-Scholes formula, and the Binomial tree method
This project applies an object-orientation aproach to compute the prices of American, Asian and European call and put options via Monte Carlo, the analytical Black-Scholes formula, and the Binomial tree method. The latter method applies the Eigen library (see http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page for more information) to generate the lattice via the Cox, Ross and Rubinstein (1979) method (see https://faculty.darden.virginia.edu/conroyb/derivatives/Binomial%20Option%20Pricing%20_f-0943_.pdf for more information).

Option metrics, such as the classic Greeks, are also computed; however, for now it's only done for European options.
